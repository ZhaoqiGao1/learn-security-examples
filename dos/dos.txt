- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
A vulnerability exposes systems to attacks, but secure versions patch these weaknesses, often through improved security measures like encryption, to block unauthorized access.
To further guard against attacks, adding layers like two-factor authentication, routine security checks, alerts for unusual activity, and regular data backups can significantly enhance protection.
