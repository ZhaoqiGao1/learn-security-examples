- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
A DoS vulnerability lets attackers flood a system with so much traffic it can't handle normal requests anymore.
Secure versions prevent this by using traffic filtering, rate limiting, and detecting unusual activity patterns to block the overflow.
To beef up defenses against such attacks, implementing network firewalls, using DDoS mitigation services, setting up redundant network paths, and constantly monitoring for suspicious traffic can be effective strategies.
