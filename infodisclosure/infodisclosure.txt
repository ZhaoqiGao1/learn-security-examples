What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

A vulnerability is essentially a security flaw that attackers can exploit, but secure versions counter this by enhancing protections, such as encryption.
Tampering with data violates the Integrity principle, indicating unauthorized alterations.
To bolster security further, employing measures like two-factor authentication, conducting regular vulnerability assessments, implementing intrusion detection systems, and maintaining data backups is advisable.
